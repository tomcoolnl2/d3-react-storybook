# Thank you for downloading my course!

With these demos I hope you'll learn how to build beautiful maps in D3.

## Opening Files

By default opening these demos will work in Firefox. If you use Chrome or
another browser you may need to enable access to local files. Here are some
examples to use if you're struggling to get these working.

Alternatively, you can deploy these to a web server and make sure you're using
the same protocol for accessing the libraries and files. If you have any trouble
please do not hesitate to reach out to me directly course-help@bensullins.com

##Chrome on Mac OSX From Terminal

open -a Google\ Chrome --args --allow-file-access-from-files

##Chrome on Windows

chrome.exe --allow-file-access-from-files


Enjoy!
