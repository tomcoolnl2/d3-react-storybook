[ ] Find a visualization that is interesting to you on bl.ocks.org or blockbuilder.org, which we haven’t covered in this course. Copy all the code to your local machine, and make sure that it works as expected. Go through our usual process to figure out what the code is doing.

What version of D3 is your example running on? If it uses V3, is it possible to re-write the code in V4? Can you find a community version on blockbuilder, where somebody has gone through this process already?
Make some console logs at different stages in the program, to see what format your data needs to be in. What kind of dataset would this visualization work best for? Think of at least one example.
Go through each line of the code, and make a mental note of what the program is doing. Is the code using the D3 layout pattern to add information to each data point? Does the visualization update using the D3 update pattern? Are there any “complicated black box” functions that the program is relying on?
If the visualization is most static, then what would you need to do to make it update to a changing array of data?
